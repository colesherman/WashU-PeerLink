# WashU PeerLink!

WashU PeerLink is a service that allows WashU students to easily connect with their classmates, ask their fellow students questions, coordinate group study sessions, project meetings, and much more! Simply input your schedule from WebSTAC: it will be parsed and you will be placed into all of your classes. Users also display information including first/second major and graduation year on their profile.
